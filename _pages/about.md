I am an incoming PhD student in Machine Learning at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ece.gatech.edu/), where I will be conducting research at the [AVA Lab](https://larryheck.github.io/avalab/) under Prof. [Larry Heck](https://larryheck.github.io/). My broad interests span natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL), with a particular focus on continual learning for dialogue systems. My work aims to enhance conversational AI by developing models that adapt and improve over time, enabling more dynamic and context-aware interactions.
